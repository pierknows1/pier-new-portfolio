                <p class="style-p1">This is a basic HTML and CSS website, where I added pictures and columns for the different pets that were on the shelter. During this project, I learned how to add divs for different sections. In addition, I also learned how to name every class so I can differentiate them when utilizing CSS. The CSS section includes multiple boxes and I had an image which was very large and I learned how to correctly resize it. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/pierknows1/band-website"><strong>Website</strong></a></h3>
                <p class="style-p2">This is a basic HTML website, where I added different sections to add images and text to display info about my favorite band. During this project, I was just learning how to move things around the website, everything appears out of order. This project was mostly full of differente headers to learn hierarchy. I also learned how to add images from an online source. In addition, this was good practice to put a list of dates for when the band would play.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/pierknows1/boring-lecture"><strong>Boring Lecture Website</strong></a></h3>
                <p class="style-p3">This is a basic HTML and CSS website, where I played around with different elements to add to my website. The product does not portray anything special but random elements out of order, worked on my first week at the bootcamp. For this lecture, I learned that I could link a CSS stylesheet to my HTML. I also played around with headers and how to add text as a paragraph, all of this was completed during my first week at Epicodus, as good foundation to build this portfolio website.
